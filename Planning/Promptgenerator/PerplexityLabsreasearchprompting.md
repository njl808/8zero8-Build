## Why Perplexity Labs Was Chosen for Prompt Generation Research

Perplexity Labs was selected as the primary research engine for developing the **Prompt Creator** because of its ability to perform **deep, contextual web analysis** without drifting into generic AI responses.  
Unlike traditional large language models that generate speculative answers or overproduce code, Perplexity prioritizes **source-based reasoning** — gathering information from real-world implementations, documentation, and public datasets.

This makes it an ideal foundation for researching and designing a **structured prompt system** capable of guiding other AI builders such as Open-Lovable-DIY or Bolt.new.

Where most AI systems focus on "writing" the answer, Perplexity focuses on **understanding patterns and relationships** — the key ingredients for creating a framework that can later be automated by models like GPT or Kimi.

### **Research Objective**

To design a **prompt creator** that builds **highly detailed, structured prompts** for generating complete applications and websites.

The output of this research will be a **single, comprehensive prompt** that can be fed into various AI site builders — allowing them to generate more context-aware, purpose-driven, and professional builds.

### **Working Prompt Used in Perplexity Labs**

> I want to design a prompt creator that builds highly detailed, structured prompts for generating complete applications and websites.  
> The goal is to produce a single, extensive prompt that I can feed into tools like Open-Lovable-DIY, Bolt.new, or other AI site builders.  
> The system should gather all required project information (type of app or site, brand name, purpose, content style, tone, target audience, colors, layout preferences, integrations, etc.), then output one master prompt ready for any builder to use.  
> Focus on information architecture, input flow, and context gathering rather than coding.  
> I don’t need any example code — just help me map how to make a smart, flexible prompt generator that consistently gives high-quality outputs across different AI builders.

### **Rationale**

By using Perplexity as the initial intelligence layer:
- The research phase focuses on **discovering existing frameworks** and **best practices** rather than reinventing them.  
- The system benefits from **multi-source validation** — Perplexity cross-checks data before suggesting structures or logic.  
- The generated research outputs (tables, schemas, and frameworks) form a **factually grounded foundation** for the 8zero8-build prompt engine.  
- It prevents the “AI echo chamber” effect — where one model trains on its own generated nonsense.  

Perplexity effectively becomes the **research assistant and information architect**, while GPT-5 or other models will later become the **builders and orchestrators** once the logical framework is locked in.

### **Outcome**

The expected result of using Perplexity Labs in this phase is to produce:
- A **validated information architecture** for AI prompt generation  
- A **list of best-in-class input categories and structures** for data gathering  
- A **tested master prompt template** that consistently produces detailed, usable site/app builds across multiple AI builders

Once this foundation is complete, the research will transition into the **Prompt Engine phase**, where the 8zero8-build system will begin orchestrating workers (Writer, Image, Coder, Layout) based on the schemas derived from this research.
