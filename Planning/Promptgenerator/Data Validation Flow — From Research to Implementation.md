## Data Validation Flow — From Research to Implementation

To ensure that every insight gathered by Perplexity Labs is accurate, consistent, and usable in production, the 8zero8-build project follows a structured data validation flow.  
This guarantees that only verified, repeatable logic is carried forward into prompt design and worker orchestration.

---

### **🔁 1. Research Query Initiation**
The process starts when a new research topic is identified — for example:
> "How do AI site builders gather user requirements before generating a layout?"

- The topic is logged as a new **research issue** in GitHub.  
- Perplexity Labs is used to perform broad and focused searches across multiple sources.  
- All query text and retrieved references are documented for transparency.

---

### **📊 2. Pattern Extraction**
Once multiple responses and sources are reviewed:
- Key recurring **themes, methods, and variables** are identified.  
- Common terminology (e.g., “sections,” “templates,” “context”) is normalised.  
- Redundant or conflicting data is flagged for follow-up review.

Output: a raw summary table or JSON of all identified patterns.

---

### **🧩 3. Preliminary Structuring**
Perplexity’s findings are converted into **draft schemas or prompt modules**.  
Each element is described by:
- Field name  
- Purpose  
- Dependencies  
- Example usage  

These drafts are stored under `/docs/research/drafts/` for peer or AI review.

---

### **✅ 4. Cross-Verification**
Each draft module or schema is tested against real-world examples:
- Open-source builders (Open-Lovable-DIY, Bolt.new, etc.)  
- Developer documentation or code snippets  
- Design systems and UX pattern libraries  

If two or more independent sources align with the same pattern, it is marked as **validated**.

---

### **🧠 5. Integration Review**
Validated items are reviewed in context with the overall project goals.  
Questions at this stage include:
- Does this align with 8zero8-build’s modular structure?  
- Is it model-agnostic (usable by any AI)?  
- Does it reduce ambiguity for downstream workers?

Items passing review are moved to `/schemas/` and referenced in the main prompt architecture.

---

### **⚙️ 6. Implementation Testing**
The validated schema is now tested live using free-tier AI models through:
- OpenRouter (Qwen, Coder, etc.)  
- Groq  
- Kimi K2  

Each model’s output is checked for:
- Correct field mapping  
- Logical consistency  
- Token efficiency  

Results are recorded under `/tests/validation/`.

---

### **📘 7. Documentation & Version Control**
Every validated data element is logged as:
- **Schema Version:** `schema_v1`, `schema_v2`, etc.  
- **Research Log Reference:** linked to its original Perplexity query  
- **Status:** Draft → Validated → Integrated  

This ensures all findings are reproducible and traceable.

---

### **🔄 8. Continuous Feedback Loop**
As the 8zero8-build system evolves, feedback from worker testing, user interaction, and AI performance is sent back into the research cycle.

This creates a **live improvement loop**:
