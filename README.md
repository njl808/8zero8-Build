# 8zero8-build — The Open AI Website & App Builder

## Overview
**8zero8-build** is an open-source project aiming to create a **next-generation AI builder** similar to Bolt.new or Open-Lovable-DIY — but powered entirely by **free-tier AI models** through providers like OpenRouter, Groq, and Kimi.

Instead of relying on bloated, single-prompt builders that churn out generic templates, 8zero8-build focuses on **clarity, structure, and scalability** — giving AI the context it actually needs to build intelligently while keeping the architecture modular enough to expand later into **apps, APIs, and full-stack systems**.

The long-term goal is a **browser-based platform** where users can:
- Describe their project naturally  
- Have the system gather structured data through guided dialogue  
- Generate complete, context-aware websites and apps using only free-tier AI resources  
- Preview, refine, and export their builds — all without coding knowledge or paid APIs

## Core Mission
To develop an open, extensible **AI Prompt Engine + Builder Framework** that:
- Collects all necessary project info through structured conversation or form flow  
- Generates a unified “master prompt” ready for AI builders  
- Keeps token usage low while preserving detailed context  
- Orchestrates multiple AI workers (Writer, Image, Coder, QA, Layout)  
- Uses free or self-hosted AI endpoints for true zero-cost operation

## Objectives

### Phase 1 — Foundation (Current)
- Map and refine **prompt intake categories**  
- Define **JSON schemas** for all project data  
- Document prompt logic and orchestration flow  
- Research and compare existing AI builders to extract best practices  

### Phase 2 — Orchestration
- Build the **Prompt Studio Engine** that manages inputs and outputs  
- Develop the **Worker Orchestrator** (Writer, Coder, Image, Layout, SEO)  
- Connect to free-tier AI APIs via OpenRouter, Groq, and Kimi K2  

### Phase 3 — Front-End Platform
- Create a browser-based UI (React/Vue) that mirrors the simplicity of Bolt.new  
- Implement live preview and versioning of builds  
- Add export, save, and share functionality  

### Phase 4 — Expansion
- Enable Python / API / multi-framework builds  
- Introduce project templates and community-shared prompt packs  
- Integrate with GitHub Actions for auto-deployment or sandbox previews
